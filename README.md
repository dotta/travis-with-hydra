This repository showcases and explains how to set up Travis to compile a sbt Scala project using the [Triplequote Hydra parallel compiler](https://triplequote.com/).

# Setup

Start by [requesting a free Hydra Server trial license](https://triplequote.com/hydra/trial) or contact us at [ping@triplequote.com](mailto:ping@triplequote.com) to obtain a [Hydra Open Source project license](#hydra-open-source-project-license).

The setup assumes your project is already configured to use TravisCI. If not, please read the [getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/) to setup your project to build with TravisCI.

1. Add [project/hydra.sbt](https://github.com/dotta/travis-with-hydra/blob/master/project/hydra.sbt) to your project.

2. 

# Hydra Open Source project license
A Hydra OSS license is granted to developers of non-commercial Open Source projects, with an established and active community. The license is free. However, we ask you to add a reference to Triplequote website on the web pages of your Open Source project (in particular, the README, documentation and product homepages).

Also, we kindly ask you to let us know about problems or feature request, and help us grow awarness and excitement in the community (e.g., blogging or twitter - [@triple_quote](https://twitter.com/triple_quote) is our handle).
